* The test datasets for scATAC and scRNA can be downloaded from https://codeocean.com/capsule/3904732/tree and https://1drv.ms/x/s!AuDfAP0z9Zsma9Hsr9Ggoz3MtFU?e=0RKKLU.

* The test codes are modifed from Zhang's benchmark codes for SnapATAC2. Thus, one can also reproduce all the experimental results of the compared state-of-the-art dimension reduction methods (including **ArchR, Signac, cisTopic, EpiScanpy, PeakVI, scBasset, SACLE, SnapATAC and SnapATAC2**) using the codes in https://github.com/kaizhang/single-cell-benchmark/tree/main, which requires, however, Nextflow and docker.

* We also provide reproducible program in https://codeocean.com/capsule/3904732/tree, where one can directly run the program and reproduce the results.
